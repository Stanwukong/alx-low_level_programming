# Low-level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repo contains programs written for the low-levl programming and algorithm track at ALX SE. In these projects, which occured throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data sttructures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working with the C language. The specific list of projects contained as follows:

- [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
- [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
- [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
- [0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging)
- [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
- [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion)
- [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries)
- [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x0A-argc_argv)
- [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free)
- [0x0C. C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)
