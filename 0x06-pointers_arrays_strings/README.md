# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning objectives for this project:
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:
- [tests](./tests): Tests files. Provided by Holberton School.

## Helper File :raised_hands:
- [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`. Provided by Holberton School.

## Header File :file_folder:
- [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all programs written in this project.
