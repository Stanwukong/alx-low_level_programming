# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Learning objectives for this project:
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
- **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
	- [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c): C program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
		- If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile again
		- You should not remove the path before the name of the program
